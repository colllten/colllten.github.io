## About me  

I am a former CS 18000 Head TA and currently a backend software engineer for a large midwest retailer.  
I have years of CS 18000 experience (dating back to 2020 CS Bridge) and was professionally involved in various capacities from Spring 2022 through Summer 2024.  
All of my positions involved some form of tutoring and mentoring.  

When I started in CS at Purdue, I had no programming background and significantly struggled in understanding the abstract concepts.  
After a rigorous semester, I ended with an A- in the course and became a Supplemental Instruction Leader, Student Success TA, and Head TA over the course of several semesters.

## How Sessions Work  

For the Fall 2025 semester, I am offering remote CS 18000 tutoring â€” but can be available for in-person sessions upon request.  

Sessions will utilize a mix of individual-based activities and the Supplemental Instruction model, which encourages active participation and allows the student to guide their learning.  
Whiteboarding, live coding, and mini-program demos will be employed to accelerate learning.  

I also provide a free 15-minute introductory call to get to know you and your learning style. This is optional, but highly recommended!
